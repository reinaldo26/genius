Have you ever played Genius?

Genius was a very popular toy in the 1980s. Distributed by Estrela, the toy sought to stimulate the memorization of colors and sounds. With a shape similar to a UFO, it had colored buttons that emitted harmonic sounds and lit up in sequence. It was up to the players to repeat the process without making a mistake.
